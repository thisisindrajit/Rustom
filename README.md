# RUSTOM

Rustom is a car rental/purchase website that allows vehicle dealers to showcase their car listings and customers to buy or rent these listings.
Managers/representatives of dealers maintain their stock on the database. Customers interact with the listings on the site and then can either: 

  - Rent a vehicle
  - Buy New car 
  - Buy Pre-owned car
